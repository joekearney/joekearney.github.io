  title: Nice to Pra Loup
  date: Monday, Aug 21
  strava-route: https://www.strava.com/routes/9976554
  length: 173km
  ascent: 3,700m
  cols: Ascros, Col de la Cayolle, Pra Loup
  description: Starting on the Promenade des Anglais (I should feel at home) in the centre of Nice, quickly getting out of town but with a long neutralised start. The descent from the Col de la Cayolle is a long gentle slope through a valley, with signs warning of marmottes on the road! I've seen a fair bit of this stage from rides around Pra Loup and driving back to Nice.

  title: Serre Chevalier to Alpe d'Huez
  date: Wednesday, Aug 23
  strava-route: https://www.strava.com/routes/9976826
  length: 112km
  ascent: 3,200m
  cols: Col du Lautaret, Col de Sarenne, Pas de la Confession, Alpe d'Huez
  description: One I've been really looking forward to. We see some of the Lautaret descent that features in <a href="/posts/marmotte-2017">La Marmotte</a>, then the climb up the "wrong" side of Alpe d'Huez, to see my favourite ski run at Sarenne. Down through the village and the famous 21 bends, and to the second back-route climb up the Alpe. It'll be like playing on the mountain all day!

  length: 15.5km
  ascent: 1,100m

  description: An individual time trial, straight up the mountain. My best time up here is around 1h10 at the end of La Marmotte. I'll aim for under an hour here...

  title: Alpe d'Huez to Megève
  date: Friday, Aug 25
  strava-route: https://www.strava.com/routes/9977093
  length: 182km
  ascent: 4,500m
  cols: Col du Glandon, Col de la Madeleine, Col des Saisies
  description: This one is genuinely scary, it's just massive. It'll start with a familiar feeling, following the route of La Marmotte up the Glandon, but then the Madeleine will be just brutal, with no let-up in the gradient. Maybe there'll be a bit of a break in the valley, but more likely, whatever group is left will motor on to the Col des Saisies for the finish.

  strava-route: https://www.strava.com/routes/9977165
  length: 145km
  ascent: 3,400m
  cols: Col de l'Épine, Col de la Colombière, Col de Joux Plane
  description: Unknown territory for me, here. It sounds like beautiful scenery, though with a couple of tricky descents that will likely be neutralised for safety.

  title: Morzine to Geneva
  date: Sunday, Aug 27
  strava-route: https://www.strava.com/routes/9977285
  length: 140km
  ascent: 2,600m
  cols: Col de l'Encrenaz, Col de la Ramaz, Col du Feu, Col de Cou, Col de Saxel
  description: If I make it this far, the end is in sight! A medium-length stage, but with the least climbing for a "proper" stage. The peaks are early, and the last third is mostly flat with the run-in to Geneva along the lake.
