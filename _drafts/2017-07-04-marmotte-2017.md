[haute-route]: /haute-route

The training is working, and this weekend I got actual proof.

A few days of riding in the Alps is always a joy. A small village on Alpe d'Huez, the mountain we climb no fewer than three times in August, was a base for three days of riding which I was considering a good training camp for the [Haute Route][haute-route].

The idea, with the Marmotte on the third day, was to get a base of miles (and fatigue) in the legs before the race. With a decent ride on the Friday around a mountain across the valley, and a recce of the unusual back-roads climb of the Alpe (that we hit on day 3 of the Haute Route) on Saturday, I was ready to hit 10,000m of ascent in three days. That's more than an Everest, and in line with what we'll cover in the Haute Route.

In previous years I've approached the Marmotte slightly cautiously. It's a single day that is so long and hard that the traditional choice has been not to go too hard too early, in order to leave some energy for later. This year, treating it as a training session it was an opportunity to learn what happens if I push a little harder. With a power meter, of course, this is all measurable. Whereas in previous Marmotte years I'd been limiting myself to put out around 200W or less on the climbs, the target this time was to push for 250W as much as possible. If I couldn't sustain that and ended up losing loads of time, at least I'd know.

The [first ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/1060868712), 135km/3000m from Bourg d'Oisans, the entry town to Alpe d'Huez, over Col d'Ornon and around the mountain to the west was beautiful. Some more alpine country I've not seen before, and it was great. There were big expanses of valley wilderness, cute villages, seemingly abandoned ski stations (they look out of place in the summer!) and even cows wearing actual cow bells. The roads were really quiet, I didn't see many other riders all day after the first climb.

A lot of the villages have these water stations, a small tap continuously dripping water into a stone bath. I'm still not sure if the water is drinkable, but there's a great picture from a past Haute Route of some riders cooling down sitting in one of them!

I felt strong on the climbs, and was able to sustain the power, so that's a good start. On arriving back in the flat valley up to Bourg d'Oisans, I met the first rider of the day who passed me. (It was that quiet elsewhere!) I pressed a little harder to keep up, and quickly found myself very drained of energy and not able to hold his wheel. A very similar thing happened on a recent [long ride with the Cycology club](https://www.strava.com/activities/1004988203) around Berlin. Going at tempo was fine, but extra bursts of higher effort became really hard.

In hindsight this is exactly explained by the training I've been doing, which has been single-mindedly focussed on the sort of diesel-crusing at a fixed power for a long time that will get me up mountains. I've not at all been training for bursty riding above that limit. Is that going to be a problem for the Haute Route?

***

The second day was much shorter, just a descent down the Alpe, a rolling along the valley floor for a while and then a relatively unknown climb up Alpe d'Huez that joins the famous 21 bends only six from the top.

The results are in: after a long, a short, and a very long ride, I can push towards that and not totally collapse.
