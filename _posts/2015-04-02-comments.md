Hello dear readers,

I know how desperately you've been waiting for each installment of our little saga. Well, now you get to play too!

We've added comments to posts. We'd really like to hear from you, for any purpose including:

* expressions of jealousy
* abuse for photos where it looks like we're getting a bit close to hipster (hippie?) for comfort
* recommendations of things to do, whether from personal experience or a guide book we haven't read
* book recommendations, for those days when we're trying slightly harder to stay within budget (these are rare)
* grammatical or typographical errors in our posts, for which we will set up some sort of punishment system

You get the idea.

It's really _really_ easy to sign up. Start typing, and then if you're already logged into Facebook/Gmail/whatever then just press the button. If not it's just a case of filling in an email address and thinking of a new password.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Love and hugs,
Joe and Jo
