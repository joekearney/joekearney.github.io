I bear around [one ten thousandth](http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/constituencies/E14000926) of the responsibility in my constituency for today's results. Like a moron, I sent in the application form for a proxy vote 6 days before the election, after the 6 _working_ days deadline, and it wasn't accepted. Fair enough, and I felt pretty bad about that. It wouldn't have made a difference, but that's no excuse.

The SNP are [apparently not pushing for another independence referendum](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/may/08/election-2015-live-labour-and-libdems-crushed-in-shock-election-result#block-554c6a07e4b0fd459e539024), so maybe the union will survive another parliament. It seems that we'll have an in/out referendum on the EU in a couple of years but [polling suggests that we'll stay in](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/02/24/eu-referendum-record-lead/), so maybe that union will survive too, though we may not have any friends there by 2017.

And in genuinely good news, well done for electing a record number of women MPs, a whopping ~28%. Good work.

As for everything else, I don't know what the rest of you were thinking. The NHS is already in trouble, and doesn't need still more markets and competition, let alone the suggested appointment charges. The Human Rights Act won't last long, and the Snooper's Charter will be with us soon. Legal aid [will continue to be cut until it barely exists](http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2015/02/graylings-reforms-to-legal-aid-are-damaging-and-unfair.html), judicial reviews [that have found Grayling and the MoJ to have acted unlawfully](https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/gemma-blythe/defending-rule-of-law-against-uk-government%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98slash-and-burn%E2%80%99) so many times will be prohibitively expensive or gone. Prisons will be private. Arts organisations that can't find a private benefactor will continue to be squeezed dry. Schools [are about to lose even more money](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/feb/02/conservatives-cut-school-funding-david-cameron-education-budget). Unspecified welfare cuts of another Â£12bn this year, more bedroom tax, more food banks.

The Tory approach has always been, in my memory at least, for people to lift themselves up to great heights. A nation of strivers will succeed in the #globalrace (against those of our citizens that fail?), that sort of thing. Give incentives for high performers, push the strong to excel. It's great to encourage success but those at the bottom, or those who need the safety net, just get forgotten. The bedroom tax, the benefit cap and the rest seem to start with decent intentions about giving economic incentives to move in the right direction and cutting wasted spending. But the realities are so laced with exceptions that are not understood in the system that the effects are total and regressive. Whence the food banks.

This was supposed to be "compassionate Conservatism", a label that was only coined as an alternative to "nasty party". I guess we'll see which it is. Miliband/Balls/Burnham wouldn't have been perfect, but at least a useful state would have had a chance.
