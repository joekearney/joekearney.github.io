Dear Kate,

It's great that you're coming to join us for our spin through Hong Kong and Vietnam, and we're very much looking forward to that last stretch of the holiday.

We thought now would be a good time to outline the conditions of your trip. I'm sure you'll find them agreeable.

1. **Jogging** -- you'll join us for a morning run or two through the (hilly?) streets of Hong Kong

See you at the airport,

Joe and Jo x
