Eek. The Australian leg of our trip is over and it's only a couple of weeks until we come home (sob)! Here are some highlights from our road trip through tropical Queensland:

1. Snorkelling the Great Barrier Reef -- Getting up close to an underwater world of multi-coloured fish and spiky, brain-like or clam-shaped coral. It's just how David Attenborough described it!
1. Learning to surf -- Trying to unearth my inner surfer chick on the Sunshine Coast. And failing. It's harder than it looks.
1. Sailing round the Whitsundays -- Hauling ropes, befriending Germans and getting soaked under massive waves, while speeding past idyllic islands. Really must save up for a yacht.
1. Being Dr Doolittle -- Feeding dolphins, stroking kangaroos, hunting for cassowaries, spotting crocodiles and hugging a koala -- playing with the varied wildlife of Queensland.
1. Pottering in Brisbane -- Returning to civilisation and warm weather after the NZ wilderness, and enjoying the small delights of a roof, showers, shopping and, er, salsa dancing.

No photos yet... too busy making the most of our last few weeks to upload the pics, but expect plenty of holiday spam once we're back!
