Seventeen days to go and the full detail of the routes for each stage have been released.

Here they are for all to see (mostly for my own reference!).

## Haute Route Alps 2017 routes

<ul class="listing">
{% include haute-route-stage-summary-element.html stage_strava=page.hra17-s1 stage_number=1 stage_date="Monday, Aug 21" stage_title="Nice to Pra Loup" stage_length="173km" stage_ascent="3,700m" stage_cols="Ascros, Col de la Cayolle, Pra Loup" stage_description="Starting on the Promenade des Anglais (I should feel at home) in the centre of Nice, quickly getting out of town but with a long neutralised start. The descent from the Col de la Cayolle is a long gentle slope through a valley, with signs warning of marmottes on the road! I've seen a fair bit of this stage from rides around Pra Loup and driving back to Nice." %}

{% include haute-route-stage-summary-element.html stage_strava=page.hra17-s2 stage_number=2 stage_date="Tuesday, Aug 22" stage_title="Pra Loup to Col du Granon" stage_length="127km" stage_ascent="3,700m" stage_cols="Col de Vars, Col d'Izoard, Col du Granon" stage_description="A nice potter through Barcelonnette, a grind up the valley, and then racing Chris Froome's time up Izoard, on which he all but sealed the yellow jersey this year." %}

{% capture stage4_description %}
One I've been really looking forward to. We see some of the Lautaret descent that features in <a href="/posts/marmotte-2017">La Marmotte</a>.
{% endcapture %}

{% include haute-route-stage-summary-element.html stage_strava=page.hra17-s3 stage_number=3 stage_date="Wednesday, Aug 23" stage_title="Serre Chevalier to Alpe d'Huez" stage_length="112km" stage_ascent="3,200m" stage_cols="Col du Lautaret, Col de Sarenne, Pas de la Confession, Alpe d'Huez" stage_description=stage4_description %}

{% include haute-route-stage-summary-element.html stage_strava=page.hra17-s4 stage_number=4 stage_date="Thursday, Aug 24" stage_title="Alpe d'Huez" stage_length="15.5km" stage_ascent="1,100m" stage_cols="Alpe d'Huez" stage_description="An individual time trial, straight up the mountain. My best time up here is around 1h10 at the end of La Marmotte. I'll aim for under an hour here..." %}

{% include haute-route-stage-summary-element.html stage_strava=page.hra17-s5 stage_number=5 stage_date="Friday, Aug 25" stage_title="Alpe d'Huez to Megève" stage_length="182km" stage_ascent="4,500m" stage_cols="Col du Glandon, Col de la Madeleine, Col des Saisies" stage_description="This one is genuinely scary, it's just massive. It'll start with a familiar feeling, following the route of La Marmotte up the Glandon, but then the Madeleins will be just brutal, with no let-up in the gradient. Maybe there'll be a bit of a break in the valley, but more likely it'll motor on to the Col des Saisies for the finish." %}

{% include haute-route-stage-summary-element.html stage_strava=page.hra17-s6 stage_number=6 stage_date="Saturday, Aug 26" stage_title="Megève to Morzine" stage_length="145km" stage_ascent="3,400m" stage_cols="Col de l'Epine, Col de la Colombière, Côte de Châtillon, Col de Joux Plane, Col de Ranfolly" stage_description="Unknown territory for me, here. It sounds like beautiful scenery, though with a couple of tricky descents that will likely be neutralised for safety." %}

{% include haute-route-stage-summary-element.html stage_strava=page.hra17-s7 stage_number=7 stage_date="Sunday, Aug 27" stage_title="Morzine to Geneva" stage_length="140km" stage_ascent="2,600m" stage_cols="Col de l'Encrenaz, Col de la Ramaz, Col du Feu, Col des Moises, Lake Geneva" stage_description="If I make it this far, the end is in sight! A medium-length stage, but with the least climbing for a \"proper\" stage. The peaks are early, and the last third is mostly flat with the run-in to Geneva along the lake." %}
</ul>
