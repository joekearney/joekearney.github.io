What a crazy year. After getting engaged, quitting our jobs, leaving London and [going travelling](/honeyment-index) for five months we now live in a new country!

We've talked for a long time about wanting to move abroad for a while. We looked at Australia for a while, though our parents are pleased we decided not to move so far.

Work at [SoundCloud](www.soundcloud.com) is a mix of music and engineering that I didn't expect to happen. Most people here, maybe two thirds or so, are people who have relocated for the job, and the mix of nationalities is incredible. Around my table sit people from India, Brazil, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Italy, the US and Germany. I've been able to fill quite neatly the role of the native English helper for naming things!

Life in Germany seems to be basically a game of keeping on top of admin. They love a bit of paperwork. Two days after we landed, we had to get up at 5am to get in line for an _anmeldung_, a bit of paper to say that we live in the corporate flat we had for the first month. That allowed to get a _Schufa_, a credit check to show that we aren't bankrupt in Germany. That meant we could get paid for jobs, and apply for house rental. We've taken out more forms of insurance than we can remember. We had a letter _in the post_ to tell us that the internet provider didn't have enough detail of our postal address, adding a couple of weeks to delivery. Most phone contracts seem to require you to go into the shop each month to buy more credit.

Since we moved at the start of October we have to get another _anmeldung_ for our new address (you have to get this within two weeks of moving, but there are no appointments until December)

It feels like we're close to the end of the admin. It really feels like it!
