What a crazy year. After getting engaged, quitting our jobs, leaving London and [going travelling](/honeyment-index) for five months we now live in a new country!

We've talked for a long time about wanting to move abroad for a while. We looked at Australia for a while, though our parents are pleased we decided not to move so far. Besides, [the weather didn't seem so good](/posts/tropical-storm-sydney/) there after all.

Work at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/joejkearney) is a mix of music and engineering that I didn't expect to happen. Most people here, maybe two thirds or so, are people who have relocated for the job, and the mix of nationalities is incredible. Around my table sit people from India, Brazil, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Italy, the US and Germany. I've been able to fill quite neatly the role of the native English helper for resolving grammar arguments.

Life in Germany for the first couple of months seems to have been basically a game of keeping on top of admin. They love a bit of paperwork.

Two days after we landed, we had to get up at 5am to get in line for an _Anmeldung_, a bit of paper confirming our temporary address for the first month. That allowed to get a _Schufa_, a credit check to show that we aren't bankrupt in Germany. That meant we could get paid for jobs, and apply for house rental. We've taken out more forms of insurance than we can remember. We had a letter _in the post_ to tell us that the internet provider didn't have enough detail of our postal address, adding a couple of weeks to delivery. Most phone contracts seem to require you to go into the shop each month to buy more credit.

Since we moved at the start of October we have to get another _Anmeldung_ for our new address. You're supposed to get this within two weeks of moving, but there are no appointments until December. They know they're busy so the delay doesn't cause any problems, except that after a certain date you an additional bit of paper to take to your appointment, a letter from your landlord stating that you live there. Apparently a signed contract isn't enough!

After about three months of paperwork (not to mention the four trips to Ikea) and it finally feels like we're close to the end of the admin. It really feels like it!

If Germany has failed to deliver on its reputation of efficiency, Berlin has certainly lives up to its reputation. It's cool here. Much like the [Melbourne type of cool](/posts/cafe-melbourne/), there's no pretentiousness. Everyone has tattoos of different varieties, you wear what you want, cut your hair however. And yet somehow there is still this high fashion -- on the metro you've never seen so many ways of standing out by wearing all black. I definitely feel like the middle-class Englishman not even attempting to fit in. But that's ok, there are plenty of observer-mode locals and ex-pats too.

We live on the edge of a lovely suburb of Prenzlauer Berg, full of cafes and bars, young families and little parks. The story goes that after the wall came down, everyone left to go to the west and the area was taken over by the hippies. They settled, grew up, turned into hipsters, coupled up and had babies, and now it's the most middle-class gentrified area you could imagine. We hit peak hipster while flat-hunting, when we stopped for a drink of rhubarb juice in a vegan organic cafe, next to a square full of prams.

Near our flat, Oderbergerstraße, Helmholtzplatz and Kastanienallee all have a delightful array of ways of keeping the palette busy, and we recently discovered Kulturbrauerei, an old brewery converted into a cultural centre. We've been swing dancing and been to the cinema, and as the cold nights have ramped up in bitterness the Scandinavian Christmas market has pushed back with glühwein (Glöggi to the locals!) in mugs with sugar-encrusted rims. Mmmm <abbr title="yummy!">lecker!</abbr>
