We heard all of the advice from people who have actually done this before, we even made token effort to keep our baggage light. In the end none of it mattered.

Peak baggage happened on the way from Sydney to the Blue Mountains, when we had no fewer than eight bags to carry, counting rucksacks, handbags, the tent and some food bags in addition to the damned suitcase.

After a new medium sized backpack and some repacking we've slightly improved on the sorry picture here. Next time we go travelling we'll be better organised for this, and might pay more attention to the wise words of experience that we so flagrantly ignored.
