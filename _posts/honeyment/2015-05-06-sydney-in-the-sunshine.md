Back in Sydney for our last couple of days and the weather is, finally, glorious! The bay sparkles, the Opera House gleams white against the blue sky, the ferry rides are a delight. What a difference the sun makes!

We are just settling down to lunch at Drummoyne Sailing Club, on a balcony overlooking the marina, soaking up some rays before we hit wintery New Zealand tonight. This is much more like the Sydney we had imagined. 

Pass the sunscreen. And the wine.
