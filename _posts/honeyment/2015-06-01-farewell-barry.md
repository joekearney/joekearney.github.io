The final drive was sad. I don't think we had expected to become quite so attached to our campervan, but Barry has been such a big feature of the Honeyment and it's sad to see him go.

We pulled into the depot near Auckland Airport, packed up all our things and emptied the van. We had one last celebratory Tim-Tam around the table, reminiscing about the acrobatics required to get up into the bunk-bed, how difficult it was to get up the hills and our morning coffees in the most beautiful campsites.

Barry was good to us, faultless (but for his little waste-pipe which had to be replaced in Wellington), and it was with a tear in our eyes that we bade farewell. Thank you, Barry!
