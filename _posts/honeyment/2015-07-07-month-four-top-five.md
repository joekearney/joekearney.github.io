Eek. The Australian leg of our trip is over and it's only a couple of weeks until we come home (sob)! Here are some highlights from our road trip through tropical Queensland:

1. **[Snorkelling the Great Barrier Reef](/posts/finding-nemo)** -- Getting up close to an underwater world of multi-coloured fish and spiky, brain-like or clam-shaped coral. It's just how David Attenborough described it!
1. **[Sailing round the Whitsundays](/posts/iceberg-ahoy)** -- Hauling ropes, befriending Germans and getting soaked under massive waves, while speeding past idyllic islands. Really must save up for a yacht.
1. **[Learning to surf](/posts/were-not-beach-people)** -- Trying to unearth my inner surfer chick on the Sunshine Coast. And failing. It's harder than it looks.
1. **[Being Dr Doolittle](/posts/croc-hunting-in-daintree)** -- Feeding dolphins, stroking kangaroos, hunting for cassowaries, spotting crocodiles and hugging a koala -- playing with Queensland's varied wildlife.
1. **[Pottering in Brisbane](/posts/chillin-in-brisbane)** -- Returning to civilisation and warm weather after the NZ wilderness, and enjoying the small delights of a roof, showers, shopping and, er, salsa dancing.
