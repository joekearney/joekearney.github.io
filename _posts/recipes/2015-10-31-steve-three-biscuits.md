For good measure here are three of my favourite recipes (but pretty much anything off this website is amazing).

# 1. [World Peace Cookies](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/01/in-which-world-peace-eludes-me/)

_(Not as hippy as it sounds but tried and tested and very good)_

_Makes about 36 cookies_

* 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 stick plus 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 2/3 cup (packed) light brown sugar
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon fleur de sel or 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped into chips, or a generous 3/4 cup store-bought mini chocolate chips

Sift the flour, cocoa and baking soda together.

Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter on medium speed until soft and creamy. Add both sugars, the salt and vanilla extract and beat for 2 minutes more.

Turn off the mixer. Pour in the flour mixture, drape a kitchen towel over the stand mixer to protect yourself and your kitchen from flying flour and pulse the mixer at low speed about 5 times, a second or two each time. Take a peek -- if there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough, pulse a couple of times more; if not, remove the towel. Continuing at low speed, mix for about 30 seconds more, just until the flour disappears into the dough -- for the best texture, work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added, and don’t be concerned if the dough looks a little crumbly. Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate.

Turn the dough out onto a work surface, gather it together and divide it in half. Working with one half at a time, shape the dough into logs that are 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 3 hours. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. If you’ve frozen the dough, you needn’t defrost it before baking -- just slice the logs into cookies and bake the cookies 1 minute longer.)

### Getting ready to bake
Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats.

Working with a sharp thin knife, slice the logs into rounds that are 1/2 inch thick. (The rounds are likely to crack as you’re cutting them -- don’t be concerned, just squeeze the bits back onto each cookie.) Arrange the rounds on the baking sheets, leaving about one inch between them.

Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 12 minutes -- they won’t look done, nor will they be firm, but that’s just the way they should be. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the cookies rest until they are only just warm, at which point you can serve them or let them reach room temperature.

### Serving
The cookies can be eaten when they are warm or at room temperature -- I prefer them at room temperature, when the textural difference between the crumbly cookie and the chocolate bits is greatest -- and are best suited to cold milk or hot coffee.

### Do ahead
Packed airtight, cookies will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days (Deb note: not a chance); they can be frozen for up to 2 months. They can also be frozen in log form for months, and can be sliced and baked directly from the freezer, adding a coupld minutes to the baking time.

# 2. [Brownie Mosaic Cheesecake](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/08/alexs-choice/)

### Part One: One Bowl Brownies
Adapted from Baker’s One Bowl Brownies

* 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate (Baker’s chocolate, optional of course)
* 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter
* 1 3/4cups sugar
* 3 eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup flour

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 13x9-inch baking pan with foil, with ends of foil extending over sides of pan. Grease foil.

Microwave chocolate and butter in large microwaveable bowl on high for 2 minutes, or until butter is melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Stir in sugar. Blend in eggs and vanilla. Add flour and salt; mix well. Spread into prepared pan.

Bake 30 to 35 minute or until toothpick inserted in center comes out with fudgy crumbs. (Do not overbake.) Cool in pan on wire rack. Remove brownies from pan, using foil handles.

Cool brownies, then cut* them into 3/4- to 1-inch squares for use in the cheesecake. You will have more than the two cups of cubes, loosely measured, than you will need, and I’m sorry, you’re just going to have to decide for yourself what to do with the extra. Add cubes to cake batter as directed below.

I find that brownies are fantastically easy to cut once they’ve been refrigerated–you end up with nice clean lines, and in this case, a sharp pizza wheel was especially helpful. Also, brownies taste better cold. I’m just saying.

### Part Two: Crumb Crust
Adapted from Gourmet, 1999

I like a doubled crumb crust. I can’t get enough cookie. Below are proportions for one crust with the amounts to double the recipe in parentheses. You know you wanna.

* 1 1/2 cups or 5 ounces (3 cups or 10 ounces to double) finely ground cookies such as chocolate wafers. Or Chocolate Teddy Grahams.
* 5 tablespoons (10 tablespoons to double) unsalted butter, melted
* 1/3 cup (2/3 cup to double) sugar
* 1/8 (1/4 teaspoon to double) teaspoon salt

Stir together crust ingredients and press onto bottom and 1 inch up side of a buttered 24-centimeter springform pan. Fill right away or chill up to 2 hours.

### Part Three: Cheesecake
Adapted from the Three Cities of Spain Coffeehouse

* 3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
* 4 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 cups brownie cubes (from recipe above)

Make crumb crust as directed above for 24-centimeter cheesecake. Preheat oven to 350°F.

Make filling and bake cake: Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until fluffy and add eggs, 1 at a time, then vanilla and sugar, beating on low speed until each ingredient is incorporated and scraping down bowl between additions.

Fold brownie cubes in very gently and pour mixture into prepared pan. Put springform pan with crust in a shallow baking pan. Pour filling into crust and bake in baking pan (to catch drips) in middle of oven 45 minutes, or until cake is set 3 inches from edge but center is still slightly wobbly when pan is gently shaken.

When completely cool, top with following glaze.

### Part Four: Ganache Glaze
Adapted from Purdy’s original recipe

* 3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, broken up, or 1/2 cup chocolate morsels
* 2 ounces butter
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 tablespoon confectioners sugar

Grind the chocolate into powder in the food processor, scald the butter and cream in a saucepan (or in a Pyrex cup in the microwave). With the machine running, pour the hot cream/butter mixture slowly through the feed tube onto the chocolate. Blend until completely smooth, stopping machine to scrape down sides once or twice. Add the extract and sugar and process until smooth. Spread over cheesecake while ganache is still warm. Chill until ready to serve.

# 3. [Brownie Roll-Out Cookies](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/04/brownie-roll-out-cookies/)
Recipe from Deb’s mom

* 3 cups (375 grams) all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 cup (225 grams) lightly salted butter, softened (Deb note: I don’t really see “lightly salted” much these days, so I used one stick salted, one stick unsalted)
* 1 1/2 (300 grams) cups sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract
* 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa (approximately 60 grams -- weights can vary a bit depending on brand. I use the “good” stuff–Droste, Galler or Valrhona –but I can assure you that my mother only used Hershey’s growing up, so your choice)

Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Whisk dry flour, salt and baking powder in bowl and set aside. Mix butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla and cocoa in mixer. Gradually add flour mixture, and mix until smooth. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least one hour.

Roll out cookie dough on floured counter. Cut into desired shapes, brushing extra deposits of flour off the top. (It does disappear once baked, though, so don’t overly fret if they go into the oven looking white.) Bake on a parchment-lined baking sheet for 8 to 11 minutes (the former for 1/8-inch thick cookies, the latter for 1/4-inch cookies) until the edges are firm and the centers are slightly soft and puffed.

Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
