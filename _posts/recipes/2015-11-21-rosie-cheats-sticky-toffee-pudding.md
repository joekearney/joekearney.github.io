Attached is a recipe I got out of a newspaper about 20 years ago and have made loads of times -- great for a big gathering if you double up the recipe. Not for the healthy meals section of your book though.

## For the sauce:

* 50g butter
* 110g soft brown sugar
* 110g golden syrup
* a few drops of vanilla extract
* 150ml double cream

Plus: One McVities Jamaica Ginger Cake

## Method

Put all the sauce ingredients except cream and vanilla into a heavy based pan and leave over a medium heat until the sugar has dissolved, then turn up the heat and let the mixture bubble for 5 minutes (no stirring). Take off the heat, add the vanilla extract and cream, give it a good stir and leave to cool slightly.

Cut the cake into thick slices, lay in a baking dish and pour over the sauce. Put in the oven gas 5, 375F 180C for 15 minutes until the sauce is bubbling and the cake soggy with sauce. Serve with cream or ice cream.

PS I always make two or three times this amount :)
