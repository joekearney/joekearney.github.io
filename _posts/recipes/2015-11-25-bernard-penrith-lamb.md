_Serves 4 &ndash; if making double use no more than 650ml of stock rather than 900ml._<br />
_Oven Temp. 170°_

## Ingredients

* 45g butter
* 1 onion chopped
* 450g shoulder of lamb &ndash; cubed (NB Shoulder works better than leg with this recipe)
* 40g plain flour
* 1 tablespoon. Veg. Oil
* 450ml chicken stock
* 1 tablespoon tomato puree
* 4 teaspoons clear honey
* 1 teaspoon crumbled dried rosemary salt to taste
* 2 cooking apples, peeled, cut into 1cm. Cubes
* Spiced pepper
* 25g white pepper
* 25g grated nutmeg
* 25g ground mace
* 12g cayenne pepper

## Method

Mix together spiced pepper ingredients, store in airtight jar until needed. (It will keep for many months.)

Melt half butter, add onion and cook until soft but not brown.

Add 1 teaspoon of spiced pepper & cook, stirring for 30 seconds.

Place onions in casserole dish.

Toss lamb (cubed) in flour*, heat oil & butter in frying pan & add lamb cubes, brown all over. (you may need to add a little more oil & butter but don’t overdo it.)

Add lamb to casserole, add stock, tomato puree, honey, rosemary & salt (to taste &ndash; not too much!)

Stir well.

Cover & cook in preheated oven for approx. 1 hour &ndash; until almost tender.

Add apples & stir well, cover & cook for further 30 minutes.

NB you can freeze without impairing the flavour.

*Put flour into a large plastic bag, add cubed lamb in small quantities and shake until covered.
