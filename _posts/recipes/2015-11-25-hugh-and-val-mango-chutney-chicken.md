This recipe is SO easy -- delicious and always a winner!

* 4 X Chicken Breasts (skinless)
* 1 jar of Sharwoods Mango Chutney -- if you want to spice it up use half a jar of Geeta's Premium Mango Chutney and half Sharwoods
* 1 X carton of double cream

Mix together cream/chutney and pop mixture on your chicken breasts (no need to brown chicken before if you don't want to).

Cook until chicken is tender according to your oven temperature -- I cook mine in the aga.

Before serving sprinkle with toasted almond flakes.
