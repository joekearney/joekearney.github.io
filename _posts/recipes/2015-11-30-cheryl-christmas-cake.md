For a 9 in 23 cm cake

* 1025g fruit – currants, raisins, sultanas
* 350g or more glace cherries – keep them whole
* Half a small bottle of brandy for soaking the fruit
* Grated zest of 2 oranges and 2 lemons
* 250g butter
* 250g light muscovada
* 4 eggs
* 100g ground almonds
* 75g self-raising flour
* 175g plain flour
* 1 teaspoon mixed spice
* ½tsp coriander
* ½ tsp cumin

## Method

1. Soak the fruit (not the cherries) in the brandy for a week
1. Grease and line the deep tin with greaseproof and preheat the oven to gas 3
1. Mix all the ingredients and then add in the fruit. Add some of the orange juice if it seems to dry.
1. Bake in the oven for one hour at gas 3 and then reduce to gas 1 for a further 3 hours
1. Check occasionally – a skewer should come out clean
