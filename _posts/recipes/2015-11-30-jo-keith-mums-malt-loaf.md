As you asked so nicely we thought we would share Keith's Mums malt loaf recipe (that isn't actually malt loaf). It is my favourite, and you can have it the Southern way with butter or the Northern way with Wensleydale.

The only thing she changes from the original recipe is leaving the fruit, sugar and All Bran to soak for a bit longer in the milk than an hour (sometimes overnight).
