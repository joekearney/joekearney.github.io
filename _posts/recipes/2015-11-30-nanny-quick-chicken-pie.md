* Buy a cooked chicken and take off all the meat
* Make a white sauce (milk, butter, plain flour, salt)
* Finely chop an onion and fry in a little oil or butter
* Chop some mushrooms if you like them
* Throw everything together into the white sauce

Make a plate pie (Nannyâ€™s old pyrex plate is the best) using ready roll pastry
