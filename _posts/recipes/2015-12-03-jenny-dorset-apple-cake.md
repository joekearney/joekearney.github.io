I hope you aren't overwhelmed with cake recipes already (this one is a Morris family classic)!

_serves approx. 8_

## Ingredients

* 110g margarine
* 110g caster sugar
* 175g self raising flour
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2 medium eggs
* 50g sultanas (optional)
* 3 apples â€“ peeled, cored and diced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 160c.
1. Cream the fat and sugar until it is fluffy.
1. Beat in the eggs one at a time.
1. Add the sieved flour and cinnamon, and fold in with a metal spoon.
1. Add the fruit, with a little milk if the mixture is stiff.
1. Bake in a greased 20cm tin (lined at the base) for 45 minutes, until golden and firm.  
1. When it is cool, dust the cake with either icing or caster sugar.
1. The cake is best served with Greek yoghurt, but is also nice with ice cream, cream etc. (or on its own, of course!)
