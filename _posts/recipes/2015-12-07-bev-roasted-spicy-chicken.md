This is a 'Sunday Roast' with a hit of spice! Serve with, maybe, a pilau or baked potato and plain yoghurt.

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp oil
* 2 tsp crushed garlic
* 2 tsp grated ginger
* 2 tsp tomato purée
* 150g tomatoes
* 2 tsp coriander powder
* 1/4 tsp turmeric
* 1/2 tsp chilli powder
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 2 tsp salt-seems a lot?
* 1.35 kg whole chicken
* Handful of chopped coriander for garnish

## Method

1. Fry garlic and ginger for 2 mins
1. Add the purée and cook for 2 mins
1. Add toms, powders and salt and cook for 7 mins, stirring
1. Make slits in the chicken and cover with the sauce.
1. Cook chicken at190c for1 & 1/2 hrs. Make sure it's well cooked-investigate well, it's harder with a red sauce!
1. Garnish, as you wish.

Yum xxx🐓😄😍
