_Makes 30 regular-sized cookies_

## Ingredients

* 125g unsalted butter, softened
* 225g light soft brown sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 medium egg
* 25g cocoa
* ¾ tsp ground cinnamon
* 175g plain flour
* ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
* 200g milk or dark chocolate, chopped roughly into big chunks
* 150g chopped brazil nuts

## Method

Put the butter, sugar and vanilla in a bowl and beat until smooth. Beat in the egg, then stir in the cocoa and cinnamon. Add the flour and soda, work until combined, then mix in the chocolate and nuts; I use my hands because I find it easier to scrunch up the dough and get the mixture really even.

Pinch off nuggets of dough the size of a ping-pong ball (for regular cookies) or unshelled hazelnut (for mini ones), and roll between your palms until smooth. Cover a baking tray with nonstick paper and place the soon-to-be cookies on it 3-4cm apart.

Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan-assisted)/350F/gas mark 4 and bake for eight to 10 minutes (for mini cookies) or 12-14 minutes (for regular ones). Leave to cool on the tray for a few minutes, then transfer to a rack with a spatula. Once cold, store in an airtight container.
