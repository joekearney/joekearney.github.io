## Ingredients

### For the custard:

* 150ml milk
* 275ml single cream (relative amounts of milk and cream can be varied)
* 4 large eggs
* 40g brown sugar
* 1 vanilla pod

### For the caramel:
* 110g granulated or caster sugar
* 2 tablespoons water (tap hot)

Pre-heat oven to gas mark 2, 150 C

A large 850ml ovenproof dish, round or oval preferred as this will be the shape on the serving plate

## Recipe

Put the sugar for the caramel into a saucepan and heat. The sugar will start to melt, bubble and darken, stir and continue to cook until it has become uniform liquid syrup darker than honey. Take the pan off the heat and carefully add the hot water. It will bubble and splutter but will quickly subside. Stir and when the syrup is once again uniform, very quickly pour it into the base of the dish, tipping it just a little to coat the sides.

Now pour the milk and cream into another saucepan, add the vanilla pod and leave it to heat gently. Whisk together the eggs and brown sugar in a bowl. When the milk is steaming hot, remove the vanilla pod and pour the liquid onto the egg mixture, whisking until blended. Pour the liquid into the dish and place it in a large roasting tin. Carefully put the tin in the oven and pour cold water into it to surround the dish up to two thirds of its depth. Bake for one hour. Cool and chill the crème caramel until you are ready to serve it. Free the edges by running a knife blade around the inside of the dish. Put the serving plate face down on the top of the dish and invert it onto the plate.

Recipe originally from Delia Smith.
