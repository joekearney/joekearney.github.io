Please find below a recipe that we made recently which was really yummy and which our friends said was really nice -- a great accompaniment to lots of dishes.

***

_Serves: 6_

## Ingredients

* 200g curly kale or cavolo nero
* 50g Gruyère
* 750g parsnip
* 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 red onions
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme
* 300ml double cream
* 200ml milk
* 2 garlic cloves

## Method

Thinly slice the red onions. Chop the fresh thyme. Smash the garlic cloves. Chop into 2.5cm pieces the curly kale or cavolo nero. Grate the Gruyère.

1. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6.
1. Peel and trim the parsnips, then cut into slices about the thickness of a pound coin.
1. Heat a sauté pan and add the olive oil and red onions.
1. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then sauté for 5 minutes until soft.
1. Add the thyme and set aside.
1. Pour the cream and milk into a wide pan and add the garlic and some salt.
1. Bring to a simmer, then add the parsnips and simmer for 5 minutes, until slightly softened.
1. Remove the parsnips from the pan, and reserve the liquid.
1. Meanwhile, blanch the kale for 2 minutes, then squeeze out the excess water.
1. In a deep ovenproof dish, layer the parsnips with the kale and red onion, adding a sprinkle of cheese after each layer.
1. Pour over the hot cream and milk and add a final sprinkle of cheese.
1. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove and leave to settle for 10 minutes before serving.
