Ok so this is our recipe for the book, it doesn't have a name, but we call it best lasagne!

## Ingredients

* 1 butternut squash
* Green pesto (2-3 tablespoons, depending on how much you like it...)
* 1 box of chestnut mushrooms
* 1 300ml tub of creme fraiche
* Splash of soy sauce
* Bag of spinach
* 2-3 cloves of garlic (again depending on how much you like it) chopped
* Parmesan cheese
* Approx 9 lasagne sheets
* Emmental or gruyere cheese (enough to grate on top)

## Method

1. Peel and chop the butternut squash into small cubes. Put in a roasting tin with some oil and roast until cooked. Remove from the oven, tip into the dish you're making the lasagne in and stir in the pesto.
1. Slice the mushrooms. Heat some oil in a pan and fry them until cooked, adding a few splashes of soy sauce about half way through. Drain some of the liquid away if there is a lot, then stir in a generous tablespoon of creme fraiche. Leave them in the pan until the construction stage.
1. In a separate pan fry the chopped garlic in some oil, then add the spinach a bit at a time until it's all wilted. Then stir through some Parmesan (as much or little as you like) until it melts in the spinach.
1. Cover the layer of butternut squash with lasagne sheets (no need to cook first) then spread a thin layer of creme fraiche over the top of the sheets before adding the mushrooms. Repeat with lasagne sheets and creme fraiche then add the spinach layer. Repeat again with lasagne sheets and creme fraiche and then grate the emmental or gruyere on top.
1. Cook for approx 20-30 mins at about 200 degrees until the lasagne sheets are cooked. Leave it to stand for 5 mins before serving.
