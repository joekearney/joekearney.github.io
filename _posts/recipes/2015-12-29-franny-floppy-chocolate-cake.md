I spent a bit searching for this as it was given to me many moons ago. It was from Paul's German aunt via his sister, and, if it works, is unbelievably delicious.

Somewhere from early last century, still in old measures and no cake tin size. So, it might be a bit of an adventure but.... a yummy one. Good luck.

## Ingredients

* 8oz soft brown sugar
* 8oz butter
* 4 large eggs
* 10oz wholemeal brown flour
* 5 teaspoons of baking powder
* 4 tablespoons of cocoa
* 2 tablespoons of rum

## Method

Mix into a floppy batter and bake in a large tin for 30 - 45 mins at gas mark 4. (Do not split into smaller tins)

Cut into as many layers as possible.

Fill with double cream beaten with 2oz of sugar and 2 spoonfuls of rum.
