Here's our contribution. (Entirely from Carly. My only role in the process is to eat the said cheesecake.)

## Ingredients

* Two large bars of white chocolate
* Two tubs of mascapone
* One pack of frozen raspberries, defrosted
* Half a pack of digestive biscuits
* About 100g of butter, melted

## Method

1. Crush the biscuits and mix with melted butter to form the base of the cheesecake.
1. Pour the mixture into a round (20cm?) tin which has been greased, pat down and put into the fridge to chill.
1. Break up the white chocolate and melt in a bowl over a pan of boiling water.
1. Put the mascapone into a large mixing bowl and soften with a wooden spoon.
1. Add the melted chocolate and combine well using a wooden spoon/whisk until you have a smooth mixture.
1. Stir through the defrosted raspberries to create a rippled effect (this is why defrosted frozen berries work better than fresh, but you can use fresh if you prefer).
1. Tip the mixture into the tin on top of the base and return to the fridge to set for a few hours.
