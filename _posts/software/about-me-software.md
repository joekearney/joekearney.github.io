I'm a software engineer with a focus on designing for simplicity, reliability and stability in distributed systems.

At [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) I'm building  tools to the musicians and artists who host content on the platform, and before that I was the Tech Lead of the Data Platform, working on the architecture of our data infrastructure, and guiding how we work with data across the company.
