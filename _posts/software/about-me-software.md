I'm a software engineer with a focus on designing for simplicity, reliability and stability in distributed systems.

At SoundCloud I'm the Tech Lead of the Data Platform, working on the architecture of our data infrastructure, and guiding how we work with data infrastructure across the company.

Posts here are about things I learned and found interesting, or just useful.
