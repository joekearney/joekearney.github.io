<p>(with apologies to William Walton)</p>
<blockquote><p>Kx was a great city<br />
Her merchandise was of column-per-file,<br />
Of precious types, of errors, of fine syntax<br />
Of speed, ease and simplicity<br />
All manner vessels of idiocy<br />
All manner vessels of bad design choices<br />
Of sv, :: and value,<br />
Integers, floats and matrices,<br />
Of efficiency, wine and mmu,<br />
Fine -15!, tilde, max<br />
Abort, scan, iterate, quit<br />
And the souls of men.</p></blockquote>
